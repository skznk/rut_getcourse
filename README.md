Course Sniper Bot

Hi, this is my course registation bot designed for the rutgers webreg system. It uses selenium and is operated through the terminal. 

Please clone the repository and extract all dependencies from pyproject.toml by doing "pip install ."

To use please execute "python -m cell.py" in the terminal and include the course indexes you want to snipe in the other arguments.
Example: If I want to snipe 11201 and 22121 run "python -m 11201 22121". If I want 12121 run "python -m 12121". If I want to snipe 11201, 22121, and 32122 run "python -m 11201 22121 32122". The program snipes as many indexes as you want, and you only need to run the program once there is no need to run again if a snipe is complete.

Edit the code for the specific semester you want.

Here is a recording of me using the program!
